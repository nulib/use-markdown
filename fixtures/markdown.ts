***Fāʼida* to Protect against Iron**\n\n*Translated by Paul Naylor*\n\nIn the name of God, the Most Gracious the Most Merciful. *Fāʾida* of iron: it will not cut ever, even during sleep it will not cut your body ever if God wills, by the God whom there is no God save Him. It will not hurt you. (For) seven days write it, drink and wash \[your body\] with the *zuwo* tree,[^1] *tsamiya,*[^2] *kanya*,[^3] *kauci bagaruwa*,[^4] and *samsami*[^5] and a rock called *kwan maƙera*[^6] and three *magudi*[^7] and \[the verses\]: ""There certainly has come to you a messenger from among yourselves. He is concerned by your suffering, anxious for your well-being, and gracious and merciful to the believers. But if they turn away, then say, God is sufficient for me. There is no god except Him. In Him I put my trust. And He is the Lord of the Mighty Throne.'""[^8]\n\n> Oh Haḥaḥaḥahayahīlu, oh al-Ḥaḥaḥahayhilu, Oh Hajayalhīhilu, Oh 'Ahahajayhahīlu, oh al-Ḥajayhīlu, Oh Kajaylahīlu, oh Sahahajayhayhayhīlu, Oh Ma'ahajayahīlu.[^9]\n\n[^1]: *Celtis integrifolia*, a type of hackberry.\n\n[^2]: Tamarind.\n\n[^3]: *Kanya* is a plant in the *Commelinaceae* or dayflower family. See Emmanuel Izaka Aigbokhan, *Annotated Checklist of Vascular Plants of Southern Nigeria* (University of Benin Press, 2014).\n\n[^4]: Acacia roots.\n\n[^5]: A leaf that used to be smoked like tobacco.\n\n[^6]: Literally ""egg of the blacksmiths,"" it is the ""stone"" that forms on the spot where the bellow used by the blacksmiths blows. It is made of a mixture of charcoal dust, as well as the liquefied metals (iron, silver) that were worked by the blacksmith. The ""stone"" can be used to produce inks for writing on paper.\n\n[^7]: Bargery gives the meaning as ""a large ring of small sticks, &c., tied together for use in strengthening the frames of a thatched roof."" See G.P. Bargery and D. Westermann, *A Hausa-English Dictionary and English-Hausa Vocabulary* (London: Oxford University Press, 1934).\n\n[^8]: Qurʾan 9:128-9. English translations of the Qurʾan are from Mustafa Khattab, *The Clear Quran: A Thematic English Translation of the Message of the Final Revelation* (Lombard, IL: Book of Signs Foundation, 2016).\n\n[^9]: Names of ""*rūḥānīyāt*"" (spiritual entities from the angelic realm) recognizable by the ending in -il (or -īl), such as Jibrīl (Gabriel), Mikāʼīl (Michael), etc.
